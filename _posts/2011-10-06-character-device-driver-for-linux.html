<h1>Little talk.....</h1>
<p>
 This was my 3rd assignment in System programming lab(3rd year undergrad course). The main task of this assignment is
 to design a character driver which should exist in linux kernel. I make a kernel module which
 module implements a driver that exposes two character devices to user-space. Lets clarify some topics about
 this assignment.
</p>
<h1>Kernel Module</h1>
<p>
 Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand.
 They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.
 For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware
 connected to the system. Without modules, we would have to build monolithic kernels and add new
 functionality directly into the kernel image. Besides having larger kernels, this has the
 disadvantage of requiring us to rebuild and reboot the kernel every time we want new functionality.
</p>
<h1>The Driver</h1>
<p>
 Normally a device driver sits between some hardware and the kernel I/O subsystem.
 Its purpose is to give the kernel a consistent interface to the type of hardware it "drives".
 This way the kernel can communicate with all hardware of a given type through the same interface,
 even though the actual hardware differs.
</p>
<h1>About the driver</h1>

 The figure to the left illustrates how my driver works. Basically it solves the producer-consumer problem.
 Here the two processes can be both producers and consumers. This resembles the functionality of a real hardware
 device driver, where both the hardware and the kernel can produce and consume data. </br>
 When a process writes (produces) to character device /dev/sakin-0 the data is stored in bounded buffer 1.
 If the buffer is full the process has to wait until another process has read from /dev/sakin-1.</br>
 When a process reads (consumes) from character device /dev/sakin-0 the data is read from bounded buffer 0.
 If the buffer is empty the process has to wait until another process has written to /dev/sakin-1.</br>
 Writes and reads to and from /dev/sakin-1 are handled in the same way.

<h1>Compiling and inserting the module</h1>
Makefile for compiling and creating the module sakin_dev.ko:
<pre class="brush:bash; wrap-lines:false" >
obj-m += sakin_dev.o
all:
 make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(shell pwd) modules
clean:
 make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(shell pwd) clean
</pre>
script for loading the module sakin_dev.ko and creating the device file:
<pre class="brush:bash; wrap-lines:false" >
#file name sakin_load
#!/bin/sh
module_name="sakin_dev"
device_prefix="sakin-"
mode="664"
group="root"

# invoke insmod
# use a pathname, as newer modutils don't look in . by default
insmod ./${module_name}.ko

# retrieve major number
major=$(awk "\$2==\"$module_name\" {print \$1}" /proc/devices)

# Remove stale nodes and replace them, then give gid and perms
# Usually the script is shorter, it's scull that has several devices in it.

rm -f /dev/${device_prefix}[0-1]
mknod /dev/${device_prefix}0 c $major 0
mknod /dev/${device_prefix}1 c $major 1
chgrp $group /dev/${device_prefix}[0-1]
chmod $mode  /dev/${device_prefix}[0-1]
</pre>
script for unloading the module sakin_dev.o and removing the device file:
<pre class="brush:bash; wrap-lines:false" >
#file name sakin_unload
#!/bin/sh
module_name="sakin_dev"
device_prefix="sakin-"

# invoke rmmod with all arguments we got
rmmod ${module_name}

# Remove stale nodes
rm -f /dev/${device_prefix}[0-1]
</pre>
Now compile the module by running make. If the compilation succeeds there will now be a file called sakin_dev.ko which is the module.
Create the necessary devices and insert the module by executing
<pre class="brush:bash; wrap-lines:false" >
./sakin_load
</pre>
To remove the module and to delete the devices execute:
<pre class="brush:bash; wrap-lines:false" >
./sakin_unload
</pre>
